# <a name="story"></a>6. Story

#### A dashboard is a cool feature but tableau also offers us to showcase our results in presentation mode in form of stories about which we will discuss in this section.

## Building a Story 

### `Steps`

> 1. Click the `New story` button.
> 2. From the Story pane on the left, drag the `Sales in the South` worksheet onto your view.
> 3. Edit the text in the gray box above the worksheet. This is the caption. Name it as `Sales and profit by year`.
> 4. Stories are quite specific. Here we will tell a story about selling machines in North Carolina. In the Story pane, click `Duplicate` to duplicate the first caption.
> 5. In the `Sub-Category`, filter `select` only `Machines`. This helps to gauge sales and profit of machines by year.
> 6. Rename the caption to `Machine sales and profit by year`.

## Making a Conclusion 

#### It is clear that machines in North Carolina is leading to loss of profit. However, this cannot be demonstrated by looking at Profit and Sales on the whole. For thi,s we need regional Profit.

### `Steps`
> 1. To see how Profit varies in North Carolina with years, simply Duplicate the Regional Profit dashboard focused on North Carolina.
> 2. Drag the dashboard `Regional Sales and Profit` onto the canvas.
> 3. Caption it as `Low performing items in the South`.
> 4. Select `Duplicate` to Create another story point with your Regional Profit dashboard. Select North Carolina on the bar chart.
> 5. Select All the years.
> 6. Add a caption, for example, `Profit in NC, 2014-2016`.
> 7. Select any year like 2014. Add a caption, for example, `Profit in NC, 2014` and then click Duplicate. Repeat the same for all the remaining years.



### `Hands On`

#### Now we will have an idea of which products were introduced to the North Carolina market when, and how poorly they performed. Not only have we identified a way to address negative profit, but have also successfully managed to back it with data. This is the advantage of Story in Tableau.


# <a name="saving"></a>7. Saving the work

## Tableau Desktop 

To save a Tableau workbook locally,  Select File > Save. Specify the workbook file name in the `Save As `dialog box. Tableau saves the file with the .twb extension by default.

## Tableau Public
With Tableau Public all the views and data is made public and anybody on the internet has access to it. `Select Server > Tableau Public > Save to Tableau Public` and enter the credentials.

## [Tableau Server](https://www.tableau.com/products/server)
In case the data is confidential and the story needs to be shared with the entire team, Tableau Server comes in handy.To publish a story to Tableau Server,  Select `Select Server > Publish Workbook` or `click Share` on the toolbar. But make sure to create an account first.

### That's all we need to create a good visualization in Tableau although, one might find doing a lot more revising in each stage than we did here. So with experimentation and practise, tableau becomes a lot more familiar and will unleash amazing features to help us analyze and present data. Please comment below in case of any queries or questions and Happy Visualising.

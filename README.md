## Making a Conclusion 

#### It is clear that machines in North Carolina is leading to loss of profit. However, this cannot be demonstrated by looking at Profit and Sales on the whole. For thi,s we need regional Profit.

### `Steps`

> 1. In the Story pane, select `Blank`. Drag the dashboard `Regional Sales and Profit` onto the canvas.
> 2. Caption it as `Low performing items in the South`.
> 3. Select `Duplicate` to Create another story point with your Regional Profit dashboard. Select North Carolina on the bar chart.
> 4. Select All the years.
> 5. Add a caption, for example, `Profit in NC, 2013-2016`.
> 6. Select any year like 2014. Add a caption, for example, `Profit in NC, 2014` and then click Duplicate. Repeat the same for all the remaining years.
> 7. Click on the presentation mode and let the `story` unfold.

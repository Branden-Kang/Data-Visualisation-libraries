## Key Findings
Let's take a closer look at the filters to find out more about the unprofitable products.

###  `Steps`

> 1.  In the view, in the `Sub-Category` filter card, clear all of the check boxes except `Bookcases, Machines,` and `Tables`. This throws an interesting fact. While in some years, Bookcases and Machines were actually profitable. However, in 2016, Machines became unprofitable.
> 2. Select `All` in the `Sub-Category` filter card to show all sub-categories again.
> 3. From Dimensions, drag `Region` to the `Rows` shelf and place it to the left of Sum(Sales). We notice that machines in the South are reporting a higher negative profit overall than in your other regions. 
> 4. Let us now give a name to the sheet. At the bottom-left of the workspace, double-click `Sheet 1` and type `Sales by Product and Region`.
> 5. In order to preserve the view, Tableau allows us to duplicate our worksheet so that we can continue in another sheet from where we left off.
> 6. In your workbook, right-click the `Sales by Product and Region` sheet and select `Duplicate` and rename the duplicated sheet to `Sales-South`.
> 7. In the new worksheet, from Dimensions, drag `Region` to the `Filters` shelf to add it as a filter in the view.
> 8. In the Filter Region dialogue box, clear all check boxes except South and then click `OK`. Now we can clearly focus on sales and profit in the `South`. We find that machine sales had a negative profit in 2014 and again in 2016. We will investigate this in the next section
> 9. Lastly, do not forget to save the results by selecting  `File > Save As`. Give your workbook a name, like `Regional Sales and Profits`.

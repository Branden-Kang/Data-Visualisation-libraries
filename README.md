> 3. In the Data pane, right-click Order Date and select Show Filter.It seems that Machines, tables, and binders donâ€™t seem to be doing well. So should we stop selling those items in Jacksonville, Concord, Burlington, Knoxville, and Memphis? Let's verify.
> 4. Go back to the Profit Map sheet tab.
> 5. On the Data pane, right-click Sub-Category and select Show Filter.
> 6. From Measures, drag Profit to Label on the Marks card.
